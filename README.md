The sketches were made using the [ixfx framework](https://ixfx.fun).

The purpose of the sketches was to explore grabbing and grapsing interactions
using multitouch on a touch-screen. In search of finding nuance in multitouch 
interactions, we found inspiration from the metaphor of raking leaves.
Our final framing was "a bunch of undorded objects". 

These sketches are three different explorations of that framing. 

- Sketch v1: Selecting and moving objects on the screen using all fingers.
- Sketch v2: Introducing the trail of interaction. Physical forces that keep
going after interaction has ended.
- Sketch v3: Collecting and organizing objects. A combination of the two 
previous sketches. The nuance between selecting/ collecting and grabbing. 

## How to use the sketches: 
You can try out the sketches on a tablet by downloading the code, opening it in
VS Code and launching the website with an extension like [Five Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server). To run the sketches on the tablet, make sure to open the `network` link provided by Five Server (e.g. `https://10.4.5.111:5500`).

> Note: If you are using a VPN, make sure to have the tablet and computer connected by a cable. 

Feel free to modify the code for your purpose.
